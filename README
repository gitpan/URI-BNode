NAME
    URI::BNode - RDF blank node identifiers which are also URI objects

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        my $bnode = URI::BNode->new;

        print "$bnode\n"; # something like _:EH_kW827XQ6vvX0yF8YzRA

METHODS
  new [$ID]
    Creates a new blank node identifier. If $ID is undefined or empty, one
    will be generated using Data::UUID::NCName. If $ID has a value, it must
    either begin with "_:" or conform to the blank node syntax from the
    Turtle spec. Other values, including other URIs, will be passed to the
    URI constructor.

  opaque [$NEWVAL]
    Replace the blank node's value with a new one. This method will croak if
    passed a $NEWVAL which doesn't match the spec in
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#BNodes>.
